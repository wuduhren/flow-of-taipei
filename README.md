# How I implement This
I have no clue how to use deck.gl, so I follow the steps on [Getting Started](https://deck.gl/#/documentation/getting-started/installation) in its document.  

After you successfully build and see the first example, you can dive in to other directories in `examples/website` basically just `npm install` and `npm start` to see all of them.  

This repository is adapted from `trips`.  

I think the hard part is to think of what data do I wanted to visualize. Here are some place to get inspiration.
